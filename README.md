# Data Science Profile
This code helps generate a Data Science profile as described in "Doing Data Science" by Cathy O'Neil and Rachel Schutt.  They say that a Data Scientist usually has skills in many different areas, specifically Mathematics, Statistics, Computer Science, Machine Learning, Communications, Visualization, and Domain Expertise.  I think these naturally group together as follows:
* Mathematics & Statistics
* Computer Science & Machine Learning
* Communciation & Visualization
* Domain Expertise

The authors also mention (and I agree!) that you don't have to be good at all of these.  Rarely does this "unicorn" exist that is a master of all seven.  In practice, Data Science teams are assembled to complement each other's skillsets and round out the teams Data Science profile.

My Data Science profile (as generated by this code) is given below.

As you can see, my skills in Math and Statistics are higher (I have undergrad degrees in Math and Finance as well as an MS in Statistics) than the other areas.  I've been focusing on improving my Machine Learning and Computer Science skills over the past year and a half.  While I still have a long way to go, I've made great strides in those areas.  I was blessed with my Dad's comfort and ease with public speaking and communication in general, so I would like to think my Communication ability is relatively high.  However, while I've dabbled in d3.js, my Visualization skills could use some improving.  And finally, being young in my career, my Domain Expertise is not too great at all.  While working at [Clarabridge](http://www.clarabridge.com/), I've learned quite a bit about Natural Language Processing (NLP), but I still have a lot to learn!  Luckily, I get to work with a Linguist regularly and I'm always gleaning information where I can.

One final thing to note is that this is an ever evolving profile.  If you would have looked at my profile in January 2014 (going into my last semester of grad school), my Mathematics and Statistics would have been higher, while my Computer Science and Machine Learning would have been quite a bit lower.  However, I've put most of my effort towards improving in those two areas while still maintaining my Mathematics and Statistics knowledge.
